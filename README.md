# bingEm
Points are earned if you use Bing as your search engine, but only so many a day. To make it easier to get the alloted points per day, a python script is pretty easy to use to quickly go through some searches. You can pass this script the language you want it to search for. It has an array of words that you pass a language into that combins to make a sentence to say: "WORD_FROM_ARRAY in LANGUAGE".

You have to be logged into your Microsoft live account for it to count the points towards your account. I use Chrome so the script does too.
